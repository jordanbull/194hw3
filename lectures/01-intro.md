# Protocol games:

- *Start right on time to induce restarts for non-monotonicity.*

- "How many of you have programmed in language X".  Language Y?  Language Z?

    - Volunteer 1.  Protocol: handraise, count hands, write answer on board.

- Now Simon Sez.
    - How was programming language query different from Simon Sez?

- Tokens: ball, cards, pen-and-paper.

    - Volunteer 2: "What percentage of you have taken CS162?"
    - Volunteer 3 & 4:  One counts EECS majors, one counts Seniors.  
    - Volunteer 5: Now, Google Doc.  EECS, Seniors, Total -- all in parallel.
        - [The Doc](https://docs.google.com/a/cs.berkeley.edu/document/d/1ZXXRgtfrTUHMSe-Hj06dX98eV9n92xIoeLHltMITpmQ/edit)
        - [Limits](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=2494827)
    - "Has anyone NOT programmed in Java?"  "Who can't hear me?"

- Discuss

- How many Tweet responses can you get in 5 minutes: #programthecloud #berkeley.  Prize -- Amazon MP3.
    -> WHO WON?
    -> AUDIT.
    
# Discussion
- What is Cloud?

- Better: what is a distributed system?

- Even better: how does a distributed/cloud platform impact a programmer?  (A.k.a. Who Cares?)

# Administrivia

Goals of this class:

- Distributed systems fundamentals: What are the primary concerns.  Why might people think they're hard.  How can we minimize the hard stuff, and focus the programmer constructively on things they need to address?
- Exposure to cloud programming, via AWS.  Nuts and bolts, sure.  But focus on design patterns and software engineering practices.  Testing for scale and failure.
- Experimentation with new research approaches -- specifically the ideas of Disorderly Programming, CALM consistency and the Bloom language coming out of Berkeley.  
- Exposure to industry vets and their experiences.

Non-Goals:

- Teaching you a new programming language.  You can hopefully do this yourself.
- Ins and outs of working with a cloud service like AWS.  You may pick this up along the way, but RTFM.
- Teach you a specific software service (Hadoop, Cassandra, etc.)  You may pick this up along the way
- Figuring out who gets what grade.  It's a 194.  There is no bell curve.  This is not a drill.  Do well or don't sign up.

Am I ready for this class?

Structure:

- First half of the class is fairly scripted: Tuesdays will be lecture/discussion, Thursdays will be Coding Together.  
- We have specific software projects designed to reinforce this material.  Expect to be coding steadily!  The race is on, the pace is hot!
- As the semester progresses, we will have more latitude: guest speakers from industry (Twitter, MS, Salesforce...)
- Once we work through the coding projects we've designed for learning, there will be time to do independent coding projects.
