# Protocol games:

- Start right on time to induce restarts for no-monotonicity.

- "How many of you have programmed in language X".  Language Y?  Language Z?
- "What percentage of you have programmed in language X?"
- "How many people are here anyway?"

- Volunteer counter.  Protocol: handraise, count hands, write answer on board.
- "How many of you have NOT programmed in Java?".
- "Has anyone not programmed in Java?"

- Another volunteer.  One counts EECS majors, one counts Seniors.  
- How many were neither?

- That was fun.  How is this problem different from Simon Sez?


What is Cloud?

Better: what is a distributed system?

Even better: how does a distributed/cloud platform impact a programmer?  (A.k.a. Who Cares?)

# Administrivia

Goals of this class:

- Distributed systems fundamentals: What are the primary concerns.  Why might people think they're hard.  How can we minimize the hard stuff, and focus the programmer constructively on things they need to address?
- Exposure to cloud programming, via AWS.  Nuts and bolts (using VMs etc). Design patterns and software engineering practices.  Testing for scale and failure.
- Experimentation with new research approaches -- specifically the ideas of Disorderly Programming and CALM consistency and the Bloom language coming out of Berkeley.  

Non-Goals:

- Teaching you a new programming language.  You can hopefully do this yourself.
- Ins and outs of working with a cloud service like AWS.  You may pick this up along the way, but RTFM.
- Teach you a specific software service (Hadoop, Cassandra, etc.)  You may pick this up along the way
- Figuring out who gets what grade.  It's a 194.  There is no bell curve.  This is not a drill.  Do well or don't sign up.

Am I ready for this class?

Structure:

- First half of the class is fairly scripted: Tuesdays will be lecture/discussion, Thursdays will be Coding Together.  
- We have specific software projects designed to reinforce this material.  Expect to be coding steadily!  The race is on, the pace is hot!
- As the semester progresses, we will have more latitude: guest speakers from industry (Twitter, LinkedIn, Yammer, OpsCode...)
- Once we work through the coding projects we've designed for learning, there will be time to do independent coding projects.

Let's talk about failure.
